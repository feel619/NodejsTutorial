# What is Node.Js ?

* Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source, Javascript Runtime Environment that allows you to run Javascript outside the browser. So we can run javascript on Windows, Mac, Linux and more..
* Normally, Javascript Runs only in browser. All browsers have separate engines to run JavaScript. example Firefox-SpiderMonkey,Google-V8, Safari-JavaScriptCore,Chakra-Internet Explorer. But Node.js lets us run javascript on the server using V8 engine.
* V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript execution engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is primarily designed to execute JavaScript code. V8 Engine compiles JavaScript Code directly to Machine code.

# Why Use Node.js

* Its use javascript - easy to learn & same language for frontend and backend, and large community of javascript
* Very fast - build on google chrome's V8 engine
* Non-blocking & asynchronous - great for handling many users and mulitple taks at same time
* Huge ecosystem- thousand of packages using NPM

# Common use case
* Real-time Applications: Building chat applications, online games, and live-streaming services.
* APIs and Backend Services: Creating fast and scalable RESTful APIs to support web and mobile applications.
* Data Streaming: Efficiently handling audio and video streaming by processing data while it's still being uploaded.
* Command-Line Tools: Many modern frontend build tools and task runners are built on Node.js.
* Creating microservices and single-page applications (SPAs). 
* Internet of Things (IoT) Applications Node.js is well-suited for handling the multiple concurrent requests and real-time communication needs of IoT devices and systems, such as tracking and monitoring applications.
