# What is Node.js?

* Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser. It can run on operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
* Normally, JavaScript runs only inside web browsers. Each browser has its own JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript code —for example:
    * Firefox uses SpiderMonkey
    * Google Chrome uses V8
    * Safari uses JavaScriptCore
    * Internet Explorer uses Chakra
* Node.js enables JavaScript to run on the server by using the V8 JavaScript engine outside the browser environment.
* The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript execution engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is designed to execute JavaScript efficiently. V8 compiles JavaScript code directly into machine code, which makes it very fast.

# Why Use Node.js

* Its use javascript - Easy to learn, Same language for frontend and backend, and large community of javascript
* Very Fast Performance - Built on Google Chrome’s V8 engine, which executes code quickly and efficiently.
* Non-Blocking & Asynchronous Architecture - Handles many users and multiple tasks at the same time without blocking requests—great for scalable apps.
* Perfect for Real-Time Applications - Chat applications, Live notifications, Streaming services, Online gaming...
* Huge ecosystem- thousand of packages using NPM

# Common use case
* Real-time Applications: Building chat applications, online games, and live-streaming services.
* APIs and Backend Services: Creating fast and scalable RESTful APIs to support web and mobile applications.
* Data Streaming: Efficiently handling audio and video streaming by processing data while it's still being uploaded.
* Command-Line Tools: Many modern frontend build tools and task runners are built on Node.js.
* Creating microservices and single-page applications (SPAs). 
* Internet of Things (IoT) Applications Node.js is well-suited for handling the multiple concurrent requests and real-time communication needs of IoT devices and systems, such as tracking and monitoring applications.
